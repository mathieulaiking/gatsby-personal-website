import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

24 years old, from a little French Island in the Indian Ocean called 'La RÃ©union'.
I have a Master of Science in 'Software Conception and Big Data' acquired in 2021 from CPE Lyon. 
I am passionate about AI and most particularly NLP and like to read new articles about it (by following researchers and organizations on social medias : Twitter, LinkedIn).
On the other hand, I love sport and I have been playing volleyball and beach volley for 9 years including 3 years in a club . I am also a musician and have been playing guitar for 14 years.
